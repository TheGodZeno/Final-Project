# Final-Project

This is my final Andoird studio project for now, I made a space invaders game with pure Java.
All the login and stuff as such I used the res folder but the game itself is pure Java only.

I will add the WORD file of the project consisting a full walkthrough of the app later.

NOTE: You might have noticed that I did only 2 commits all this time the reason is that I didn't understood git back then and most of my commits were in my system thus I had more than 2 commits actually, I just didn't push them.
